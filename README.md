We mentioned our efforts to construct a relevant dataset. We are pleased to offer access to this Multi-disease Paired Ocular Synthesis (MPOS)
dataset. We invite researchers working on **Image synthesis**, **Retinal Disease Diagnosis**, and **Medical Imaging and Analysis** to make use of this valuable resource. 

Please contact Hongqiu (hongqiuwang16@gmail.com) for the dataset. One step is needed to download the dataset: **1) Use your google email to apply for the download permission ([Google Drive]() [BaiduPan]()). We will get back to you within three days, so please don't send them multiple times. We just handle the **real-name email** and **your email suffix must match your affiliation**. The email should contain the following information:

    Name/Homepage/Google Scholar: (Tell us who you are.)
    Primary Affiliation: (The name of your institution or university, etc.)
    Job Title: (E.g., Professor, Associate Professor, Ph.D., etc.)
    Affiliation Email: (the password will be sent to this email, we just reply to the email which is the end of "edu".)
    How to use: (Only for academic research, not for commercial use or second-development.)
